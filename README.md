Things Ready
============
Things Ready is a simple and fast way to manage things for them to finish.

## Technologies
Built on Java Plataform with JDK 7, Java EE 6, CDI, JPA and JSF. The beauty and responsiveness is up to the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

The main idea is to use Twitter Bootstrap with JSF but if we have an interesting result why not create a management tool?

## Community
I hope that many developers join the project to create an excellent use case.
